		<h2>The Couple</h1>
		<p>
			You know the story - girl meets boy in sweaty Bangkok back in 2014. Crowd goes wild. Bada-bing, bada-boom, they are inseparable for the next decade of shenanigans. After roughly 3,287 passport stamps and enough immigration office meltdowns, these two then finally decided to just get hitched already. Was it the countless visa fees that broke them? The judgy looks from customs agents? Or just Justin's inability to remember to file paperwork on time? The world may never know. But one thing's for sure - Pink and Justin are certifiably in loveeee. (With each other and their fur baby Abu, who unfortunately can’t join the wedding, but he’ll be the Pup of honor in their heart). So grab your swimsuit and get ready to par-tay Thai-style as these two lovebirds make it official! Let's just hope Justin doesn't miss his own wedding after misplacing one of his visa documents (again)...
