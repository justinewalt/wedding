              These homies are Justin's parents and boy are they parents! They have yelled at him many times (almost all deservingly so) and they have also loved him for about 35 years (minus years 15-22).
              Major shoutout to them for making all this possible and being ever supportive of Justin and his constant terrible decisions. They love Pink, finally a decision they approve of!              </p>

              Pink's parents are awesome and take care of us. None of this would be possible without them, and they put up with Justin and his sarcasm which we all appreciate.
